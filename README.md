# Rational Number Class

Simple rational class with operators. <br>
In this code u can you class aswell operators. <br>
Also you can change double number to rational number. <br>

Input first number numerator = 4 <br>
Input first number denominator = 2 <br>
Input second number numerator = 1 <br>
Input second number denominator = 3 <br>

First number is 2 <br>
Second number is 1/3 <br>

Some calculations : <br>
2/1 + 1/3 = 7/3 <br>
2/1 - 1/3 = 5/3 <br>
2/1 \* 1/3 = 2/3 <br>
2/1 / 1/3 = 6/1 <br>
Now compate numbers:<br>
Is 2 bigger than 1/3 ? Yes <br>
Is 2 less than 1/3 ? No <br>
is 2 equal to 1/3 ? No <br>

Changing double to rational number :
