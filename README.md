# Rational Number Class

Simple rational class with operators.
In this code u can you class aswell operators.

Input first number numerator = 4
Input first number denominator = 2
Input second number numerator = 1
Input second number denominator = 3

First number is 2
Second number is 1/3

Some calculations :
2/1 + 1/3 = 7/3
2/1 - 1/3 = 5/3
2/1 \* 1/3 = 2/3
2/1 / 1/3 = 6/1
Now compate numbers:
Is 2 bigger than 1/3 ? Yes
Is 2 less than 1/3 ? No
is 2 equal to 1/3 ? No
